# Robotics Module Documentation

This script is part of a robotics module, possibly for a four-wheel robot with various sensors and actuators.

## Script Setup

- **Shebang**: `#!/usr/bin/env python3` ensures the script runs with Python 3.
- **Encoding**: `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` specifies the encoding used (UTF-8).

## Imports

Imports classes and functions from local modules:
- `PWM`, `ADC`, `Pin`, `Motor`, `Servo`, `Ultrasonic`, `Speed`, `FileDB`, and various utility functions.
- `time` module for time-related functions.
- `__version__` for version info from `.version`.

## Initial Setup

- Performs a soft reset and waits for 0.2 seconds to ensure a clean start.
- Loads configurations from a file (`config`) and sets up motor reverse settings and ultrasonic servo offset.

## Motor Initialization

- Initializes four motors (`left_front`, `right_front`, `left_rear`, `right_rear`) with PWM and pin configurations. Reversal settings are applied based on configuration.

## Speed Sensors (Commented Out)

- Sets up speed sensors for the rear motors.

## Sensor Initialization

- Initializes three grayscale sensors (`gs0`, `gs1`, `gs2`) and an ultrasonic sensor (`us`).
- Initializes a servo (`servo`) for the ultrasonic sensor with an offset.

## Functions

### `start_speed_thread()`

- Starts the speed measurement threads for the rear motors.

### Grayscale Functions

- `get_grayscale_list()`: Returns readings from the grayscale sensors.
- `is_on_edge(ref, gs_list)`: Determines if any sensor detects the edge based on a reference value.
- `get_line_status(ref, fl_list)`: Returns the line status (-1, 0, 1) based on grayscale readings and a reference value.

### Ultrasonic Functions

- Functions for scanning with the ultrasonic sensor (`get_distance_at`, `get_status_at`, `scan_step`) and moving the servo to different angles.

### Motor Control Functions

- `forward(power)`, `backward(power)`, `turn_left(power)`, `turn_right(power)`, `stop()`: Functions to control the robot's movement.
- `set_motor_power(motor, power)`: Sets power for a specific motor.
- `speed_val()`: Returns the average speed of the rear motors.

## Main Loop

- Starts the speed measurement threads.
- Continuously moves the robot forward and prints the speed value.

## Notes

1. The `speed_val()` function seems to be primarily using rear motor speeds. If front speed sensors are added or needed, the function might require updating.
2. Some functions (e.g., for grayscale and ultrasonic sensors) imply that the robot might be used for line following or obstacle avoidance tasks.
3. Error handling and logging (in `do` and `run_command` functions) are in place, ensuring that command execution issues are tracked.
4. The script seems modular, and it appears that components (motors, sensors) can be easily reconfigured or replaced. This is evident from the use of configuration files and independent initialization of each component.
5. Ensure that the `config` file exists and has the correct structure to prevent potential runtime errors.
